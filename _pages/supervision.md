Applications to the @London_NERC_DTP are now open!
24 positions are available, starting in September 2021. https://london-nerc-dtp.org/apply-to-the-london-nerc-dtp/
If you wanted to do a PhD with me on solar geoengineering at UCL, this is the route to take though 1st choice of project is not guaranteed.

I am also open to collaborating with post-docs, though I have no funded positions available at present.

## MSc Students

I supervise master's students at UCL through the MSc programs offered by Earth Sciences. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects. I would be happy to discuss the master's proposals I've posted or discuss ideas for projects that align with my research interests.

## PhD Students

Current Openings:
* NERC DTP project: [Using machine learning to predict the response to solar geoengineering](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/2020/07/27/using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-response-to-solar-geoengineering/).

If you are interested in working with me, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL. When getting in touch, please make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own based on my publications.

To get details on the application process for PhDs at UCL, see [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/applying-graduate-study/what-you-need-complete-application). You can also find tips on writing a convincing research statement on [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/sites/prospective-students_graduate/files/potential-supervisor.pdf).

The main route for securing a PhD to work with me would be through the [*London NERC DTP*](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/apply-to-the-london-nerc-dtp/). However, several schemes independent of UCL may also be of interest. A list of possible options is provided [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/funding-students-postgraduate-research-courses#charities), and the [following tool](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder) may be of help when searching for a scholarship you are eligible for. Depending on your country of origion, you may also be eligible for a [fee partnership from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/fee-partnerships). Finally, one other option is the commonwealth PhD scholarships; see [this page](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/) or [this page](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/)).

### Current Students

* **Wei Liu**, Master's student at UCL, Earth Sciences (since May 2020).

* **Hao Chen**, Master's student at UCL, Earth Sciences (since July 2020).

### Former Students

* **Susanne Glienke**, Diploma Thesis (Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, 2014), title: "Climate-Vegetation Interactions in GeoMIP". Now Post Doctorate Research Assistant at PNNL.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.
