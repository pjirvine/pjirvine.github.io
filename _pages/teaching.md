I lead the 2nd year undergraduate module Principles of Climate (GEOL0013) at UCL Earth Sciences, along with [Dr. Michel Tsamados](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people/academic/dr-michel-tsamados)]. This module aims to describe and explain the basics of climate science, and to equip students with an understanding of how and why the climate is changing. The module also aims to build a basic understanding of the options available to tackle climate change and the impacts that climate change will have on society and ecosystems. The moduleâ€™s practical work includes analysing the climate response to solar geoengineering in specific countries.

The Moodle page for enrolled students can be found [here](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=23061).

The module scored an overall student satisfaction of 4.0 / 5 for the '20-'21 academic year, and 3.7 / 5 for '19-'20.
